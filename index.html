				<h2>First Data Analysis</h2>
				<h3>Japan Medal Count</h3>

				<p>For our first data anyalsis, we decided to look into Japan's record from 1924 to 2014. The pie chart demonstrates the percentages of how many gold, silver and bronze medals Japan has won during the years. We realized that Japan actually won almost the same amount of medals in gold, silver and bronze. The Second chart, which is a bar chart, shows that Japan won two gold medals from 2002 to 2014. We wanted to put all the data from 1924 to 2014 into a bar chart in the first place. Unfortunately, matplotlib broke down after absorbing too much information. So, that is all we have.</p>

				<h2>Second Data Analysis</h2>
				<h3>Canada VS United States VS The Rest of The World</h3>

				<p>We wanted to do our second data analysis on places that we have been to which are Canada and United States. Well, we definately hope that we have been to everywhere in the world. Back to the fisrt chart, it is again a pie chart that demonstrates the percentages of three different groups. It is very obvious that if you add up all the medals Canada and United States have won, it is very very close to fourth of the whole world. The bar chart simply shows how many medals they won from 1924 to 2014.</p>

				<h2>Third Data Analysis</h2>
				<h3>Male VS Female</h3>
				<div class="imageBox">
				<img src="images/male_vs_female.jpg" alt="male vs female">
				<img src="images/male_vs_female_since_2002.jpg" alt="male vs female since 2002">
				</div>
				<p>The last data analysis, we did male versus female. We were inspired by what we did in class, so we did our last two charts based on it. Again, we started with an easy-to-read pie chart that tells us how much of a percentage male had during the years and, on the other hand, female as well. Male certainly takes up more of the pie than female. Due to the scientfic facts that men are more physically qualified to do a lot of strength needed activities, we were not surprised by the chart. The other chart, which Sandra is very proud of because it took her only 10 minutes to create after the long research on how to make a line chart, it shows the mumbers of male compares to female from the year of 2002 to 2014.</p>
